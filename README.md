# Bugs

If the default example not added to your software isn't functioning how it should, please join the Discord server https://discord.gg/keyauth and submit the issue in the #bugs channel.

However, we do NOT provide support for adding KeyAuth to your project. If you can't figure this out you should use Google or YouTube to learn more about the programming language you want to sell a program in.

# Security practices

* Utilize obfuscation provided by companies such as VMProtect or Themida (utilize their SDKs too for greater protection)
* Preform frequent integrity checks to ensure the memory of the program has not been modified
* Don't write the bytes of a file you've downloaded to disk if you don't want that file to be retrieved by the user. Rather, execute * * the file in memory and erase it from memory the moment execution finishes

KeyAuth is provided in Source Code Form. The burden of client-side protection is on you the software developer, as it would be with any authentication system.

# KeyAuthApp instance definition

Visit https://keyauth.cc/app/ and select your application, then click on the C++ tab

It'll provide you with the code which you should replace with in the [main.h](https://github.com/ash05051995/example-x86-/blob/main/example%20x86/main.h) file

```
std::string name = "example"; // application name. right above the blurred text aka the secret on the licenses tab among other tabs
std::string ownerid = "JjPMBVlIOd"; // ownerid, found in account settings. click your profile picture on top right of dashboard and then account settings.
std::string secret = "db40d586f4b189e04e5c18c3c94b7e72221be3f6551995adc05236948d1762bc"; // app secret, the blurred text on licenses tab and other tabs
std::string version = "1.0"; // leave alone unless you've changed version on website
std::string url = "https://keyauth.win/api/1.2/"; // change if you're self-hosting

api KeyAuthApp(name, ownerid, secret, version, url);
```

# Initialize application

You must call this function prior to using any other KeyAuth function. Otherwise the other KeyAuth function won't work.

```
KeyAuthApp.init();
if (!KeyAuthApp.data.success)
{
	std::cout << skCrypt("\n Status: ") << KeyAuthApp.data.message;
	Sleep(1500);
	exit(0);
}
```
